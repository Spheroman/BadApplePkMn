# BadApplePkMn
Every frame is generated by converting each pokemon card into 4 pixels, 2 in each dimension. I convert the frame into a much smaller image, and then i compare the 2 of them by using the pythagorean theorem (color is a vector, after all) and I match 4 pixels on the bad apple image to a card. Afterwards, i added all of the cards together and saved them. Each frame takes about 20 seconds to render with the optimizations i made, and with multithreading my computer chewed through them all in around 2.5 hours.
